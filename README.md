# Disclaimer

It is totally forbidden to unprotect (remove the password) and distribute the pdf files of active machines, if I detect any misuse will be reported immediately to the HTB admins.  
Anyway, all the author of the writeups of active machines in this repository **is not responsible** for the misuse that can be given to the corresponding documents. Please think that this is done to share techniques not for spoilers.
